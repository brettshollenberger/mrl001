ON HOLD
-------

- [FEATURE / BUG] Clicking "save" on edit pages should not redirect to index pages. 
@NOTE this will require angular 1.2 to do elegantly.... else we need the workaround as seen in the passwordChange controller. 




DELEGATE
-------

- [CHORE] On quote and application edit page, show text in title bar as per design comps. 
- [CHORE] Make sure all money / costs have dollar signs and commas!
- [STYLE] On dashboard pages, most all inputs and textareas should be 100% width
- [STYLE] Prevent textareas from being widened. Make them scroll instead and set a max-height
- [STYLE] Application page needs to match comps
- [STYLE] Buyout program page needs to match comps
- [STYLE] Add placeholder image for vendor logo
- [STYLE] Standardize hrs/ h3 underlines. 
- [STYLE] Match double columns on bottom of vendor edit form



TODO
